# Saved Items Feature Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the saved items feature with folder organization for the "Talk To Your History" Chrome extension.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Save Functionality**
- Users can save search results to organized folders
- Users can save the current tab they're viewing
- Each saved item includes: URL, title, optional summary, source type, and timestamp

### 2. **Folder Management**
- Create new folders with custom names
- Rename existing folders
- Delete folders (and all contained items)
- View item count for each folder
- Dropdown selector to switch between folders

### 3. **User Interface**
- **Tab Navigation**: Two tabs in the popup - "Search" and "Saved"
  - Search tab: Existing search functionality (unchanged)
  - Saved tab: View and manage saved items
- **Save Button**: Added to each search result card
- **Save Current Tab Button**: Appears in header when on the Saved tab
- **Folder Selector**: Dropdown with folder management options
- **Saved Item Cards**: Similar to result cards but with delete functionality

## Technical Implementation

### Database Layer (IndexedDB)

**Updated `src/background/db.ts`**
- Increased database version from 1 to 2
- Added two new object stores:
  - `folders`: Stores folder information (id, name, createdAt, itemCount)
  - `saved_items`: Stores saved items (id, folderId, url, title, summary, savedAt, sourceType)
- Implemented CRUD operations:
  - Folders: `createFolder()`, `getFolders()`, `renameFolder()`, `deleteFolder()`
  - Items: `saveItem()`, `getSavedItemsByFolder()`, `deleteSavedItem()`

### Type Definitions

**Updated `src/types/models.ts`**
```typescript
export type Folder = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  createdAt: number;
  itemCount: number;
};

export type SavedItem = {
  id: string;
  folderId: string;
  url: string;
  title: string;
  summary?: string;
  savedAt: number;
  sourceType: 'search' | 'current-tab';
};
```

**Updated `src/types/messages.ts`**
- Added 7 new message types for save operations
- Corresponding message interfaces for type safety

### Background Script

**Updated `src/background/index.ts`**
- Added message handlers for all save-related operations:
  - `SAVE_ITEM`: Save a new item to a folder
  - `GET_FOLDERS`: Retrieve all folders
  - `CREATE_FOLDER`: Create a new folder
  - `RENAME_FOLDER`: Rename an existing folder
  - `DELETE_FOLDER`: Delete a folder and its items
  - `GET_SAVED_ITEMS`: Get items for a specific folder
  - `DELETE_SAVED_ITEM`: Delete a saved item

### UI Components

**Created Components:**

1. **`TabNavigation.tsx`**: Tab switcher between Search and Saved views
2. **`SaveButton.tsx`**: Button with folder selection modal
   - Shows list of existing folders
   - Inline folder creation
   - Saves item to selected folder
3. **`FolderSelector.tsx`**: Dropdown selector with management options
   - Select active folder
   - Create new folder
   - Rename folder
   - Delete folder (with confirmation)
4. **`SavedItemCard.tsx`**: Card component for saved items
   - Displays item info (title, URL, summary, saved date)
   - Open, Copy URL, and Delete buttons
5. **`SavedView.tsx`**: Main view for the Saved tab
   - Folder selector at top
   - List of saved items
   - Empty states for no folders/items

**Updated Components:**

1. **`ResultCard.tsx`**: Added Save button to each search result
2. **`popup.tsx`**: Main integration
   - Tab state management
   - Conditional rendering of Search/Saved views
   - Save Current Tab button in header

### State Management

**Created `src/ui/store/savedStore.ts`**
- Zustand store for managing saved items state
- State properties:
  - `folders[]`: List of all folders
  - `savedItems[]`: Items in the active folder
  - `activeFolder`: Currently selected folder
  - `isLoading`: Loading state
  - `error`: Error messages
- Actions for all CRUD operations
- Automatic folder switching and item reloading

**Updated `src/ui/lib/chromeApi.ts`**
- Added wrapper functions for all save-related message passing
- Type-safe API for UI components to communicate with background script

### Styling

**Updated `src/ui/styles.css`**
- Modal overlay and content styles
- Dropdown menu styles
- Tab content styles
- Disabled button states

## User Workflows

### Saving a Search Result
1. User performs a search
2. Results appear with "Save" button
3. Click Save → Modal opens showing folders
4. Select existing folder OR create new one
5. Item is saved to folder

### Saving Current Tab
1. Navigate to "Saved" tab
2. Click "Save" button in header
3. Select/create folder in modal
4. Current tab is saved

### Managing Folders
1. Go to "Saved" tab
2. Use folder dropdown to switch between folders
3. Click "⋮" menu for options:
   - New Folder: Create a new folder
   - Rename: Rename current folder
   - Delete: Delete folder and all items (with confirmation)

### Viewing Saved Items
1. Go to "Saved" tab
2. Select folder from dropdown
3. Browse saved items
4. Click "Open" to visit URL
5. Click "Copy URL" to copy to clipboard
6. Click "Delete" to remove item (with confirmation)

## Data Flow

```
UI Component → chromeApi wrapper → Chrome Message → Background Handler → Database Operation
     ↓
UI State Update (Zustand store)
```

## Files Changed/Created

### Created Files (9)
- `src/ui/store/savedStore.ts`
- `src/ui/components/TabNavigation.tsx`
- `src/ui/components/SaveButton.tsx`
- `src/ui/components/FolderSelector.tsx`
- `src/ui/components/SavedItemCard.tsx`
- `src/ui/components/SavedView.tsx`
- `SAVED_ITEMS_IMPLEMENTATION.md` (this file)

### Modified Files (7)
- `src/types/models.ts`
- `src/types/messages.ts`
- `src/background/db.ts`
- `src/background/index.ts`
- `src/ui/lib/chromeApi.ts`
- `src/ui/components/ResultCard.tsx`
- `src/ui/popup.tsx`
- `src/ui/styles.css`

## Database Migration

The database automatically migrates from version 1 to version 2 when the extension is reloaded. The migration:
1. Preserves existing `pages` store
2. Creates new `folders` store
3. Creates new `saved_items` store

Existing user data is not affected.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Create folders**: Test creating folders with various names
2. **Save items**: Save both search results and current tabs
3. **Folder operations**: Test rename and delete operations
4. **Empty states**: Verify UI handles empty folders/no folders gracefully
5. **Item limits**: Test with many folders and items
6. **Edge cases**: 
   - Long URLs and titles
   - Special characters in folder names
   - Deleting folder with many items
   - Duplicate saves (same URL in multiple folders is allowed)

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

- Search within saved items
- Tags/labels for saved items
- Export/import saved items
- Folder sorting options
- Bulk operations (select multiple items)
- Saved item previews/thumbnails
- Keyboard shortcuts for save operations

## Notes

- The search functionality remains completely unchanged as requested
- All data is stored locally in IndexedDB
- Folder deletion is irreversible (with user confirmation)
- Item counts are dynamically calculated when loading folders
- The implementation follows the existing code style and patterns
